### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

Check it out below:

```html ðŸŽ‰
<header>
   <img src="./images/logo.svg" alt="calculator logo displaying the name of the app splitter">
</header>
```
```css ðŸŽ‰
@media screen and (min-width: 992px) {
    header img {
        margin: 4rem auto;
    }

    main {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: space-between;
        gap: 3rem;
        border-radius: 20px;
    }
```
```js ðŸŽ‰
function getTipNumber(e) {
    let tipPercentage = e.target.value;
    if (tipPercentage != 0) {
        tipNumber = Number(tipPercentage.substring(0, tipPercentage.length - 1));       
        console.log(tipNumber);
        tipCalculation();
    } else {
        customTip.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
            tipNumber = Number(e.target.value);
            tipCalculation();           
        });       
    }  
}
